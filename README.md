# SimNautica

This repository contains two implementations of a software project based on UML diagrams provided by the University of Michigan. The project has been developed in both Java and C++ to demonstrate different approaches to the same design.

## Project Structure

- **Java/**: Contains the implementation of the project in Java, including all relevant source files, resources, and build configurations.
- **C++/**: Contains the implementation of the project in C++, with all corresponding source files, resources, and build configurations.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:
